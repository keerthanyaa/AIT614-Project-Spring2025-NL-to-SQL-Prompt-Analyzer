# NL2SQL Prompt Engineering Analyzer

## Description

This project is an analysis and evaluation framework designed to systematically study the impact of various prompt engineering techniques on the accuracy of SQL query generation by Large Language Models (LLMs). It focuses on the Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) task, by comparing model performance across standard benchmark datasets (like Spider, WikiSQL) and simulated real-world database scenarios which often feature unstructured schemas and domain-specific ambiguities.

The framework allows users to input natural language questions, apply different prompting strategies (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Structured/Domain-Specific [, Chain-of-Thought - TBC]), generate SQL queries using configurable LLMs (e.g., GPT, LLaMA), execute these queries, and evaluate their accuracy using metrics like Exact Match (EM) and Execution Accuracy (ExecAcc).

*(Based on the project proposal dated approx. April 2025, Fairfax, VA)*

## Objectives

* Explain how different prompt engineering techniques influence SQL query generation accuracy in NL2SQL models.
* Compare the performance of NL2SQL models on benchmark datasets versus real-world databases.
* Identify optimal prompt strategies for increasing query accuracy and model generalization.
* Provide insights into the real-world usability and robustness of NL2SQL models in practical business environments.

    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You need to add necessary packages like `streamlit`, database drivers, LLM SDKs, etc., to `requirements.txt`)*

4.  **Configure Settings:**
    * Update `config/settings.py` with your LLM API keys and database connection details (once the DB setup is complete).

## Usage

To run the main user interface:

```bash
streamlit run app/main_streamlit.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server, and you can access the application through your web browser at the displayed local URL.

Logging

Application logs (including errors and informational messages) are configured in config/logging_config.py and are written to the logs/ directory (e.g., logs/nl2sql_analyzer.log) and also displayed on the console.

To test the mongo-db connection : 

```bash
python -m storage.test_mongo_connection
```

To run the Scripts of postgresql : 

```bash
python scripts/create_postgres_dbs.py
```

## Working Components

This section describes parts of the application that are implemented and functional, even if some underlying operations (like LLM calls or DB saves) are currently simulated.

### Streamlit Interface (`app/main_streamlit.py`)

* **Entry Point:** The application is launched via `streamlit run app/main_streamlit.py`.

* **Layout:** Features a wide layout with:
    * A **Sidebar** for global configuration (selecting Dataset, Prompt Technique, LLM) and for entering optional Ground Truth SQL for evaluation purposes.
    * A **Main Area** organized into Tabs: "NL Query Test", "Evaluation Analytics" (placeholder), and "Run History" (placeholder).

* **NL Query Test Tab:**
    * Allows users to input a natural language query.
    * A button ("Run Generation & Evaluation") triggers the backend LangGraph workflow.
    * Displays a loading spinner during processing.
    * Shows the generated Prompt and the (currently simulated) SQL output received from the graph. use 
```bash 
python -m graph_logic.graphs
```
    * Displays placeholder Evaluation Scores (EM/ExecAcc).
    * Includes an interactive **Feedback Section** (rating slider, issue selection, comments) that appears after generation; submitting feedback logs the input and context (simulated save).

* **State Management:** Utilizes `st.session_state` to maintain user inputs, configuration selections, generated results, and UI visibility across interactions.

### Logging of Step-by-Step Process

* **Configuration:** Logging is configured via `config/logging_config.py`, setting up formatters and handlers (typically console and potentially file output to the `logs/` directory).

* **Execution Trace:** Detailed logs (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`) are generated throughout the application flow:
    * Records user selections (Dataset, Prompt, LLM) and the input NL query when generation is triggered.
    * Logs the invocation of the backend LangGraph workflow (`run_nl2sql_graph`).
    * Traces execution within the LangGraph graph, logging entry into key nodes (`route_preparation`, specific `fetch_..._prompt` nodes, `call_llm_node`).
    * Shows the routing decision made based on the selected prompt strategy.
    * Logs details of the (currently simulated) LLM interaction within `sql_gen.py`, including which LLM client class was instantiated.
    * Captures submitted feedback details and the associated query context.
    * Records any errors encountered during graph execution or Streamlit processing.
* **Purpose:** Provides essential visibility for debugging and understanding the step-by-step execution path, including the conditional logic flow within the LangGraph agent.

### MongoDB Integration (`storage/db_handler.py`)

* **Purpose:** MongoDB (Atlas) is used as the persistent storage backend for logging experiment run details and user feedback.
* **Connection:**
    * Connection logic is handled in `storage/db_handler.py`.
    * The MongoDB connection string (`MONGODB_CONNECTION_URL`) is loaded securely from `config/.env` using `python-dotenv`.
    * The `certifi` library is used to provide necessary CA certificates for successful TLS/SSL connections to Atlas.
    * A standalone test script (`storage/test_mongo_connection.py`) is available to verify the connection logic independently (run via `python -m storage.test_mongo_connection` from the project root).
* **Operations:**
    * `log_result`: Saves the context (inputs, outputs, config, scores) of each NL2SQL run to the `experiment_runs` collection in the `nl2sql_analyzer` database. This is integrated into the Streamlit app (Tab 1) and triggers after a successful query generation.
    * `save_feedback`: Updates the corresponding run document in `experiment_runs` with user feedback (rating, issues, comment). This is integrated into the feedback submission logic in the Streamlit app (Tab 1).
    * `fetch_run_history`: Retrieves logged runs from the `experiment_runs` collection, supporting filtering. This is integrated into the Streamlit app (Tab 3) to display recent history by default and allow filtered searches.
* **Status:** Connection, logging, feedback saving, and history fetching are implemented and integrated with the Streamlit UI. Data is successfully being written to and read from MongoDB Atlas.

### LLM Integration & Structured Prompting

The below 2 API calls can be made for testing the NL2SQL Generated Query : 

* Openai GPT-4o-mini 

* Gemini 1.5 Flash

There are 3 main prompts used : Zero-Shot ; Few-Shot and Structured/Domain Specific.

* **Real LLM Calls:** The placeholder LLM calls have been replaced with actual API interactions.
    * Client classes (`OpenAIClient`, `GeminiClient`) are implemented in `graph_logic/sql_gen.py` to handle calls to specific models (e.g., "GPT-4o Mini", "Gemini 1.5 Flash").
    * API keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) are loaded securely from the `config/.env` file.
    * Token usage (prompt, completion, total) is now logged for each API call.
* **Structured Prompt Path:**
    * Implemented a multi-step workflow within LangGraph for the "Structured/Domain-Specific" prompt strategy.
    * **Static Schema:** Uses pre-defined static schema representations (stored as Python lists/dictionaries in `graph_logic/schema.py`) for both benchmark and real-world datasets. Descriptions, column details (as a multi-line string), and foreign keys are included.
    * **Schema Processing:** Functions in `graph_logic/schema_utils.py` handle reading the static schema (`get_all_table_names_and_descriptions`) and filtering it based on predicted relevant tables (`fetch_specific_metadata`).
    * **Table Prediction:** Includes a dedicated node (`call_prediction_llm` in `schema_utils.py`) that generates a prompt (using `generate_table_prediction_prompt` from `prompts.py`) and calls an LLM to predict relevant tables based on the user query and table descriptions.
    * **Prompt Assembly:** Functions in `graph_logic/prompts.py` assemble the final prompt text based on the chosen strategy (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or Structured using the fetched specific metadata).
* **SQL Validation:** A basic Pydantic validator (`SQLQueryValidator` in `sql_gen.py`) is applied to the final output of the SQL-generating LLM (`call_llm_node`) to check if it starts with common SQL keywords, preventing non-SQL text from being processed further.
