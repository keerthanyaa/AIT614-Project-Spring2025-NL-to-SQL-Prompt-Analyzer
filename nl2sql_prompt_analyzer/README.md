# NL2SQL Prompt Engineering Analyzer

## Description

This project is an analysis and evaluation framework designed to systematically study the impact of various prompt engineering techniques on the accuracy of SQL query generation by Large Language Models (LLMs). It focuses on the Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) task, comparing model performance across standard benchmark datasets (like Spider, WikiSQL) and simulated real-world database scenarios which often feature unstructured schemas and domain-specific ambiguities.

The framework allows users to input natural language questions, apply different prompting strategies (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Structured/Domain-Specific [, Chain-of-Thought - TBC]), generate SQL queries using configurable LLMs (e.g., GPT, LLaMA), execute these queries, and evaluate their accuracy using metrics like Exact Match (EM) and Execution Accuracy (ExecAcc).

*(Based on the project proposal dated approx. April 2025, Fairfax, VA)*

## Objectives

* Explain how different prompt engineering techniques influence SQL query generation accuracy in NL2SQL models.
* Compare the performance of NL2SQL models on benchmark datasets versus real-world databases.
* Identify optimal prompt strategies for increasing query accuracy and model generalization.
* Provide insights into the real-world usability and robustness of NL2SQL models in practical business environments.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd nl2sql_prompt_analyzer
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Linux/macOS
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Windows (cmd)
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    # Windows (PowerShell)
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You need to add necessary packages like `streamlit`, database drivers, LLM SDKs, etc., to `requirements.txt`)*

4.  **Configure Settings:**
    * Update `config/settings.py` with your LLM API keys and database connection details (once the DB setup is complete).

## Usage

To run the main user interface:

```bash
streamlit run app/main_streamlit.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server, and you can access the application through your web browser at the displayed local URL.

Logging
Application logs (including errors and informational messages) are configured in config/logging_config.py and are written to the logs/ directory (e.g., logs/nl2sql_analyzer.log) and also displayed on the console.
